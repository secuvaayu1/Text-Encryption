## ‚ú® Features

-   **Strong, Authenticated Encryption:** Uses `AES-256-GCM` to provide both confidentiality and data integrity, preventing tampering.
-   **Robust Key Derivation:** Implements `PBKDF2` with a high iteration count to stretch a user-provided master passphrase into a strong encryption key, protecting against brute-force attacks.
-   **Secure Salting:** Generates a unique cryptographic salt for every encryption, ensuring identical inputs produce different encrypted outputs.
-   **Stunning 3D Interface:** Built with **Three.js**, the UI features an interactive particle field that reacts to mouse movement for an engaging user experience.
-   **Seamless UX:** The frontend communicates with the backend asynchronously, meaning the 3D animation is never interrupted while performing cryptographic operations.
-   **Self-Contained & Easy to Run:** The entire application runs with Node.js and has no external dependencies like databases or cloud services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Node Crypto Module
-   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Three.js
-   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (Frontend), Railway (Backend)

## üöÄ Running Locally

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher) and `npm` installed.


## üîí Security Concepts Implemented

-   **AES-256-GCM:** Galois/Counter Mode is an authenticated encryption mode. It bundles an "authentication tag" with the encrypted data. If a single bit of the ciphertext is altered, the tag becomes invalid, and decryption will fail, guaranteeing data integrity.

-   **PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2):** We don't use the master passphrase directly as the key. PBKDF2 takes the passphrase and a unique salt and puts it through a computationally intensive process (100,000 iterations). This makes it extremely slow for an attacker to guess passwords.
